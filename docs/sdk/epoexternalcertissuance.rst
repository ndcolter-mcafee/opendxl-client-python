External Certificate Authority (CA) Provisioning
================================================

.. _epoexternalcertissuance:

This page describes how to provision a client that uses certificates
signed by an externally managed Certificate Authority (CA) with an ePO-based
DXL fabric.

This is in contrast to certificates that are signed by the internal ePO
Certificate Authority (CA).

    .. note::
    
        While using an external Certificate Authority (CA) is technically possible with an OpenDXL Broker, 
        the actual steps are outside the scope of this documentation.

The following steps walk through the creation of an external Certificate Authority (CA),
generation of a client key-pair, and export of broker-related information from ePO:

* Create a Certificate Authority (CA) and Client Certificate Files (:doc:`certcreation`)
* Import Certificate Authority (CA) into ePO (:doc:`epocaimport`)
* Export the Broker Certificates (:doc:`epobrokercertsexport`)
* Export the list of DXL Brokers (:doc:`epobrokerlistexport`)

The final step is to populate the contents of a ``dxlclient.config`` file. In this particular case, the
``dxlclient.config`` file that is located in the ``sample`` sub-directory of the Python DXL SDK
will be populated.

The following steps walk through the process of populating this file:

1. Open the ``dxlclient.config`` file located in the ``sample`` sub-directory of the Python DXL SDK.

   The contents should appear as follows:

   .. code-block:: python

       [Certs]
       BrokerCertChain=<path-to-cabundle>
       CertFile=<path-to-dxlcert>
       PrivateKey=<path-to-dxlprivatekey>

       [Brokers]
       unique_broker_id_1=broker_id_1;broker_port_1;broker_hostname_1;broker_ip_1
       unique_broker_id_2=broker_id_2;broker_port_2;broker_hostname_2;broker_ip_2

       [BrokersWebSockets]
       unique_broker_id_1=broker_id_1;broker_websocket_port_1;broker_hostname_1;broker_ip_1
       unique_broker_id_2=broker_id_2;broker_websocket_port_2;broker_hostname_2;broker_ip_2

2. Update the ``CertFile`` and ``PrivateKey`` values to point to the certificate file (``client.crt``) and
   private key file (``client.key``) that were created during the certificate provisioning steps.

   See the :doc:`certcreation` section for more information on the creation of client key-pairs.

   After completing this step the contents of the configuration file should look similar to:

   .. code-block:: python

       [Certs]
       BrokerCertChain=<path-to-cabundle>
       CertFile=c:\\certificates\\client.crt
       PrivateKey=c:\\certificates\\client.key

       [Brokers]
       unique_broker_id_1=broker_id_1;broker_port_1;broker_hostname_1;broker_ip_1
       unique_broker_id_2=broker_id_2;broker_port_2;broker_hostname_2;broker_ip_2

       [BrokersWebSockets]
       unique_broker_id_1=broker_id_1;broker_websocket_port_1;broker_hostname_1;broker_ip_1
       unique_broker_id_2=broker_id_2;broker_websocket_port_2;broker_hostname_2;broker_ip_2

3. Update the ``BrokerCertChain`` value to point to the Broker Certificates file (``brokercerts.crt``)
   that was created when exporting the Broker Certificates.

   See the :doc:`epobrokercertsexport` section for more information on exporting Broker Certificates.

   After completing this step the contents of the configuration file should look similar to:

   .. code-block:: python

       [Certs]
       BrokerCertChain=c:\\certificates\\brokercerts.crt
       CertFile=c:\\certificates\\client.crt
       PrivateKey=c:\\certificates\\client.key

       [Brokers]
       unique_broker_id_1=broker_id_1;broker_port_1;broker_hostname_1;broker_ip_1
       unique_broker_id_2=broker_id_2;broker_port_2;broker_hostname_2;broker_ip_2

       [BrokersWebSockets]
       unique_broker_id_1=broker_id_1;broker_websocket_port_1;broker_hostname_1;broker_ip_1
       unique_broker_id_2=broker_id_2;broker_websocket_port_2;broker_hostname_2;broker_ip_2

3. Update the ``[Brokers]`` and ``[BrokersWebSockets]`` sections to include the contents of the broker
   list file (``brokerlist.properties``) that was created when exporting the Broker List.

   See the :doc:`epobrokerlistexport` section for more information on exporting the Broker List.

   After completing this step the contents of the configuration file should look similar to:

   .. code-block:: python

       [Certs]
       BrokerCertChain=c:\\certificates\\brokercerts.crt
       CertFile=c:\\certificates\\client.crt
       PrivateKey=c:\\certificates\\client.key

       [Brokers]
       {5d73b77f-8c4b-4ae0-b437-febd12facfd4}={5d73b77f-8c4b-4ae0-b437-febd12facfd4};8883;mybroker.mcafee.com;192.168.1.12
       {24397e4d-645f-4f2f-974f-f98c55bdddf7}={24397e4d-645f-4f2f-974f-f98c55bdddf7};8883;mybroker2.mcafee.com;192.168.1.13

       [BrokersWebSockets]
       {5d73b77f-8c4b-4ae0-b437-febd12facfd4}={5d73b77f-8c4b-4ae0-b437-febd12facfd4};443;mybroker.mcafee.com;192.168.1.12
       {24397e4d-645f-4f2f-974f-f98c55bdddf7}={24397e4d-645f-4f2f-974f-f98c55bdddf7};443;mybroker2.mcafee.com;192.168.1.13

4. At this point you can run the samples included with the Python SDK.
